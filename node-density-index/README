node-density-index
------------------

Osmium-based program that takes a planet file and creates from it
an index file that contains one byte for every 0.05x0.05 degree grid
square. The index value is based on a logarithm and is able to represent
numbers between 0 and about 80k.

Optionally creates a coloured heatmap PNG for the planet as well.
